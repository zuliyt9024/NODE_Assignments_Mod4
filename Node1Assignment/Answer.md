 Web Application Concepts 
* Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a web application that users see and interact with.

User Interface: It creates the design of the website such as buttons, forms, text, and layout.

User Interaction: It handles user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating pages.

Communication with Backend: It sends requests to the backend and displays the response data on the screen.

* Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend works in the background and manages the main functionality of the application.

Server-side Processing: It processes user requests and applies logic.

Database Handling: It stores, updates, deletes, and fetches data from the database.

Security and Authentication: It manages login, signup, authorization, and data protection.

* Q3. Business Logic 

Business Logic is the set of rules that define how a web application works according to business needs.

Examples:

In an online shopping app, discount is applied only if the cart value is above a certain amount.

In a banking app, money transfer is blocked if the balance is insufficient.

In an exam portal, results are shown only after the exam is completed.

* Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model explains how users and servers communicate.

Client: The browser or mobile app used by the user.

Server: The system that processes requests and sends responses.

Communication: The client sends a request, and the server responds using HTTP/HTTPS.

* Q5. Three-Tier Architecture 

3-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three layers.

Presentation Layer: Frontend interface shown to users.

Application (Business) Layer: Backend logic and processing.

Data Layer: Database where data is stored.

Why it is used:

Easy maintenance

Better security

Improved scalability

 *  Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language 

JavaScript is commonly used on the backend.

Performance: Fast and non-blocking execution.

Ecosystem: Large number of libraries available through npm.

Popular Backend Frameworks: Node.js, Express.js, NestJS.
